## 🎯 **KEY Learnings**
- Key factors influencing employee retention were identified, such as job satisfaction, compensation, and work-life balance.
- Employees with higher tenure were less likely to leave, while dissatisfaction with growth opportunities was a primary driver of turnover.
- Insights gathered from the model can be used to guide HR policies and strategies aimed at reducing turnover and increasing employee engagement.
- Imbalanced data can cause inaccuracy in predicting the minority class false negatives. In such cases we need to use **SMOTE** (synthetic minority oversampling technique)
